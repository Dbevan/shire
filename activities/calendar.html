			<summary>Archery</summary>
			<p>
				Archery is held at Nanoose Bay Pentecostal Camp, 2531 Nanoose Beach Rd, Nanoose Bay, for winter practice. We meet Tuesdays from 6-8pm. Note that, while indoors, it is still chilly, so prepare for it with warm clothes.
			
			<p>
				There is a $5 drop in fee, and a $2 equipment rental fee for those who require it. To ensure Sr Archery marshals will be present, or to check for cancellations, see the <a target=_blank rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/shireofhartwood/events>Facebook event listing</a> or the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/hartwood>Hartwood Facebook forum</a>.

			<p>
				We maximize safety on our range, so we have Rules:			
				
			<ul>
				<li>If you haven't attended this practice before, contact us ahead of time to ensure you have appropriate gear, or that we have gear to loan you on site. (email <a href=mailto:hartwood.archery@tirrigh.org>hartwood.archery@tirrigh.org</a>, or ask on the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/hartwood>Hartwood Facebook forum</a>.)</li>
				<li>All minors must be accompanied and supervised by an adult.</li>
				<li>An Tir Archery rules apply. This includes but is not limited to: no running on the range; follow marshal directions.</li>
				<li>Listen to your marshals: we are here to keep you safe.</li>
				<li>This is a practice and beginners are welcome. In order to keep the range safe for all attending, you must be able to show that you have control of the equipment you are using. If you require further training we can arrange for it on a closed range.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Be safe, be supportive, and have fun!

			<summary>Armoured Combat</summary>
			<p>
				Armoured Combat (also know as Heavy Fighting) is an exciting full-contact sport that mimics the Knights of old, fighting in full armour with sword and shield. Heavy fighting can be broken down into two distinct forms, war fighting and tournament fighting. Both share the same skill set but are greatly different.
			
			<p>
				Practice is held at Nanoose Bay Pentecostal Camp, 2531 Nanoose Beach Rd, Nanoose Bay, for winter practice. We meet Tuesdays from 6-8pm. Note that, while indoors, it is still chilly, so prepare for it with warm clothes.
			
			<p>
				There is a $5 drop in fee, and a $2 equipment rental fee for those who require it. Loaner gear is available for newcomers upon request (note: a fitting prior to practice must take place as the gear needs to fit well to provide the proper protection). Youth combat is not available at this time, though we hope to have this available in the near future; at the moment participants must be 18 years or older.
			
			<p>
				For practice notices and cancellations, see the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/shireofhartwood/events>Facebook event listing</a> or the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/hartwood>Hartwood Facebook forum</a>.

		<details>
			<summary>Arts &amp; Sciences Socials</summary>
			<p>
				Arts and Sciences is held weekly in Courtenay on Wednesdays, Campbell River on Thursdays, and Parksville on Sundays. It's held every other week on Mondays in Crofton. The times are generally from 6:30 pm to around 9ish and locales in those areas can change, so it's best to contact the <a href=mailto:hartwood.artsnsci@tirrigh.org>Arts and Sciences Minister</a> of Hartwood to confirm the locale, or check out the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/hartwood>Hartwood discussion group.</a> 

			<p>
				The get togethers are very social and friendly, and many bring their own projects when there is no group project on the go. Attendees can number from 2 - 10, and the discussions are fun and informative.

			<p>
				We hold workshops as often as we can. In the past we have had banner painting, flower petal rosaries, simple lamp making, paper making, and arrow making to name a few. We also hold two University of Tir Righ sessions a year. These are a collection of classes that our members teach to our populace and can be a full weekend. Classes have include calligraphy, weaving, drawing Celtic Knots, pouring pewter, period cooking, making armour and much, much more. Updates on workshops can be found on the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/shireofhartwood/events>Facebook event listing</a>.

			<p>
				The Arts and Sciences Office has a large umbrella that includes Bardic, Craftsmen Challenges, Dance, Music, and the many sciences. It is inclusive and fun! Come check us out!

			<summary>Council Meetings</summary>
			<p>
				You can imagine a medieval recreation group of 50,000 members takes a little coordination. Now our little Shire is only a portion of that number with just over 60 current members (though we continue to grow) but managing offices, events, reports, and Shire business takes a bit of effort. Council is where we review events gone by and plan for our future activities such as events and practices. All are always welcome.
			
			<p>
				We try to meet on a monthly basis, typically at the Quality Foods meeting room in Qualicum, 705 Memorial Ave. For more information on our next meeting, please see the Calendar below or the <a target=_blank  rel=nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/pg/shireofhartwood/events>Facebook event listing</a> or contact the <a href=mailto:hartwood.seneschal@tirrigh.org>Seneschal</a>.
		</details>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Rapier</summary>
			<p>
				Rapier combat is a full-contact sport emulating historical rennaisance sword techniques. Participants use rapiers and a wide variety of off-hand weapons to take part in war mele and/or tournament style fighting. This is a touch-sport, so light armour is worn to better sense when one has been hit.
			
			<p>
				Practice is held in Comox on Saturday evenings, 6pm - 8pm at Marina Park. There is a $2 equipment rental fee for those who require it.
			
			<p>
				Practice is also held at Nanoose Bay Pentecostal Camp, 2531 Nanoose Beach Rd, Nanoose Bay on Tuesdays from 6-8pm. Note that, while indoors, it is still chilly, so prepare for it with warm clothes. For the Nanoose Bay practice there is a $5 drop in fee, and a $2 equipment rental fee for those who require it.

				Thrown Weapons is held in Nanaimo and Courtenay on a weekly basis throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons. We are currently closed for the Winter season.
			
			<p>Instructors and loaner weapons are available at each practice. As a practical note children under the age of 13 rarely have the strength to throw the weapons. All attendees under the age of 19 MUST be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult and sign a liability waiver.

		<h3>Past Events</h3>

			<summary>Yule</summary>
				<h4>Weihnachten</h4>
					
				<p>
					Mistress Winter gently sighs her waking breath across the land leaving the magical glow that only the season of cold can bring. Mother Summer steps into her home and gently lays her head to rest as she pulls her arms close and begins her long slumber.

				<p>
					In Hartwood, we too have taken to our homes, escaping the chill of Mistress Winter, and embracing the warmth of home, hearth, friends and family. We look for reasons to celebrate, and what a better reason than to celebrate the end of harvest and the time of renewal.

				<p>
					We invite you to Weihnachten in our Medieval German Hunting Lodge.

				<p>
					On this day, we invite the Scholars, Bards and Craftsmen to bring forth their best and compete as Champions of Hartwood.

				<p>
					The day is filled with activities for the smallest to the tallest and the youngest to the oldest. We invite you to join us in medieval games, stroll the merchants, decorate cookies, participate in duels with sword, learn traditions of old, decorate our Weihnachten tree, drool over our Yule chest and enjoy a light lunch with friends.

				<p>
					In the evening, Master Godfrey von Ravensburg will reveal the meal which scents have tempted you all day. To entertain you as you dine, we will have the finals of our rapier tournament. Bid on your favourite fighter, perhaps you will win the stunning prize donated by the Artisans of Hartwood.

				<p>
					We tempt you with this brief tease and encourage you to keep watch for further missives as the date draws near.

				<p>
					The festivities begin at 10am on Saturday November 23, 2019 at the Lighthouse Community Hall 240 Lions Way, Qualicum Bay, BC.

				<p>
					Event Stewart Ban tiarna Elphin o Flaithbheartaigh is availabel for any questions.
