			There are many places you can find upcoming events. The most important one is the <a target=_blink href=http://antir.sca.org/Upcoming/index.php>Kingdom Calendar</a>, which lists all events for the region we call the Kingdom of An Tir (Oregon, Washington, parts of Idaho, and BC). Our <a target=_blank rel=_nofollow href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/hartwood>Facebook discussion group</a> posts events and practices, and this is a good place to ask questions and get updated information. Finally, you can find a listing of upcoming events and practices right here under '<a href=../activities/calendar>Calendar</a>'.

			Its important to know that not all events will have all activities. Some halls don't appreciate us lobbing arrows at their walls (shocking!), while others may be a little too small for a full ball to take place. Check out the <a  target=_blank href=https://www.antir.org/events>Kingdom Calendar</a> which will list what is planned, and any specific site rules such as camp fire bans, pet allowances, or alcohol restrictions.
