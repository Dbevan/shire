			Many of us have pets that we'd like to include in the SCA experience, and, when event site rules allow it, we welcome them. 

		<p>
			SCA rules require that all pets be under control at all times, usually on a leash, and all droppings picked up and disposed of appropriately. Keep in mind that others may have reason to avoid pets, and so respect their space and their wishes. Note that "My pet is just being friendly" is often viewd as aggression, and permitting it could result in an invitation to leave.

		<p>
			Help your pet enjoy the event by ensuring they have private space for their comfort, sufficient shelter from the weather, adequate food, and easy access to potable water.
