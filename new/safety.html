			We have a lot of acronyms and obscure terms that get bandied about. We know this can be a problem and try to avoid them in new company, but if we forget ourselves and you have no idea whats being talked about please give us a gentle nudge and we'll be happy to explain. A more thorough listing of jargon can be <a target=_blank href=http://sca.org/officers/chatelain/pdf/jargon.pdf>found online</a>, but it's more than you need to know to start with.

			The most important thing to know is 'HOLD'. Hold is the safe-word we use to ask everyone to stop what they are doing and pay attention to their surroundings; archers will un-nock their arrows, fighters will freeze in place, and spectators should glance around to see what the problem is. Usually it's something simple like a bit of armour has come loose, or an animal has wandered onto the range; once it's rectified, activities carry on. If you see an imminent safety risk, everyone is empowered to call 'Hold!'.

			Always listen carefully when a town crier belts out his notices; some may be important and relevant to your interests, such as activities beginning, lost items, or someone leaving their car lights on.
