			Just as people had children in the Middle Ages, so do we! They dress the part, and enjoy some activities directly with adults, other activities with children's categories, and still other activities for children under the supervision of their parents. We don't provide child-care (baby-sitting services), yet activities are available for both parent and child. 

		<p>
			Children have been known to actively create and provide messenger services, carry water to thirsty fighters, and even help with set-up and take-down of camps. One enterprising crew create a trash and recycling service - true entrepreneurs!

			Courtesy is expected of even the young ones, and here is a good place to practice.

		<p>
			If you intend to bring a niece, nephew, friend of the family – any child that you are not the legal guardian of – terrific! But to avoid frustration and disappointment, please download the form found here: <a target=_blank href=http://www.antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/04_MinorMedical_CAN.pdf>04_MinorMedical_CAN.pdf</a> and have it filled out and signed by their parent, along with a photo copy of that parent's ID, <strong>before</strong> arriving on site. Please note that everything other than the name and signature can be blacked out; it is simply for a comparison. Gate will not retain this.
