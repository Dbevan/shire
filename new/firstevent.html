			There are many types of events: tourneys; war scenarios; feasts; formal classes; arts &amp; sciences, and bardic competitions. Some events are a single day, others may span a weekend or more and involve camping.
		
		<p>
			When you arrive at any event, your first stop should be at 'Gate'. This is where you sign in, and either pay or redeem a pre-paid ticket. Non-members will be asked to sign an additional waiver; a copy can be found on the <a target=_blank href=http://www.tirrigh.org/downloads/seneschal/07_Consent_to_Participate.pdf>Principality Website</a> if you would like to read it. While non-members are welcome to participate, SCA members recieve a discounted admission.
		
		<p>
			What should you bring? That depends on what type of event you'll be attending, and what kinds of activities you'd like to participate in. In all cases, your gate fee (or ticket), any required paperwork for minors you are accompanying (see below), an attempt at pre-17th century garb, and any dishes you may require for eating should be brought. Advice on feasting, clothing, and camping specifically can be found below. Beyond that, bring whatever you might like to entertain you and the specific event has facilities for; a period board game, a recorder, or your bow and arrows for example.
		
		<p>
			Please let us know if you are new, especially if you have sewing skills and have whipped up an exceptional first bit of garb! We would like to welcome you and ensure you know what's happening, but sometimes newcomers are stealthy and we think they're simply visiting from afar.
