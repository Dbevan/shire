				We consider ourselves a helpful and polite society, so we observe all the courtesies. Nod and bow to all in passing and in greeting. Call each other 'milord' and 'milady' as appropriate. Offer to lend a hand if you can.

			<p>
				In the SCA, we have ranks and titles given to us. In some cases, such recipients may wear a fancier circlet, such as a coronet or crown; wearers of fancy circlets warrant a deep bow. For more information, see <a href=../library/etiquette.html>Forms of Address</a>.

			<p>
				If you attend court, it is polite to be attentive and quiet unless otherwise invited by the court herald or the Royalty on the thrones. Even conversation at the back of the hall can disturb others who are straining to hear the business at hand.

			<p>
				Note that each campsite is someone's "home", so we respect campsite boundaries, and ask before crossing them.
