			Be prepared for all weather! We in Hartwood, and the Kingdom of An Tir, generally don't let a little weather slow us down. Bring what camping gear works for you, and make it comfortable. Many of us include sun/rain shelters in our gear for cooking and lounging. 

		<p>
			Sites will sometimes have "quiet areas" and "noisy areas". It's a somewhat arbitrary designation that may help you decide on your campsite, staying up with the revellers or getting up with the sun/children. Note that each campsite is someone's "home", so we respect campsite boundaries, and ask before crossing them.

		<p>
			Have a good sleeping kit! A good sleep will offset any discomforts of the day. Changing into dry clothes to sleep will help you sleep better. The <a target=_blank href=http://www.currentmiddleages.org/tents/cold.html>Current Middle Ages</a> website has an excellent article on keeping warm at a cold event.

		<p>
			Bring enough food and water, as both will be consumed in quantities that might surprise you. 

		<p>
			Be sure to protect yourself from the sun with a sun hat and sunscreen; even cloudy days can leave a nasty burn.

		<p>
			Have a set of clothing for the end of the event in a zip-loc bag, or other waterproof container. If it's been a wet event, packing up in dry clothing is more comfortable.

		<p>
			Remember to clean up your campsite when you are done: our custom is to leave a place cleaner than we found it.
