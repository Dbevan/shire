				As a newcomer, the SCA asks only that you "make an attempt at pre-17th century clothing". Suitable clothing (also called "garb") helps you to get into the mood, and helps you fit in with others at the event.

			<p>
				The basic kit includes:

			<ul>
				<li>tunic and trews for men and children (and even women);</li>
				<li>long gown for women (if not doing tunic and trews);</li>
				<li>belt as needed;</li>
				<li>pouch for belt, or shoulder bag (to hold necessaries such as car keys, ID, cash, etc.);</li>
				<li>cap or hat is optional (and highly recommended for outdoor events);</li>
				<li>any footwear to protect your feet.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				A basic tunic could be as easy as a super-long, long-sleeved T-shirt, or a long "poet's shirt", belted; if you are up for sewing, you can easily make a tunic from a plain cotton bed sheet. We can help!

			<p>
				Trews (trousers) can also be simple, like pull-on plaid pyjama bottoms; we won't see the elastic waistband under the tunic!

			<p>
				A gown is ideally simple, ankle-long, with long sleeves. You can use a tunic and long skirt to get the same effect, or a shorter gown with a skirt under. Note that cleavage is subject to sunburn at camping events, so protect yourself!

			<p>
				Headwear completes an outfit! A simple coif, with or without a simple straw hat works well for camping. If you luck into a wool hat blank, it can be worn as is, or configured to taste.
