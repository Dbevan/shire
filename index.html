				<h3>Armoured Combat &amp; Rapier</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>
					An iconic part of our Society's activities, armoured combatants particpate in tournaments, melees and war scenarios. Weapon and armour requirements have been developed to ensure safety and an engaging experience. Hartwood trains weekly throughout the year; limited loaner gear is available. Please contact our <a href=officers.html>Minister of Stables</a> for more information.
				<p>
					Recreating later-period sword fighting, rapier fighters are known for elegance and speed. Similar to modern fencing, we use a variety of weapons and lighter armour than the Armoured fighters. Training is weekly throughout the year, with loaner gear available for those who would like to give it a try. Please contact our <a href=officers.html>Minister of Blades</a> for more information.
