		<p>
			Freeze pre-cooked stew/soup to help keep other food cold; it will thaw eventually.
		<p>
			Open cooler only as needed, to keep it cold. Consider a separate cooler for beer and similar bevers.
		<p>
			Consider having snacks available for "company": baked goods, easily prepped fresh fruits and veg, tea, hot chocolate, whatever your friends like.
		<p>
			Even if drinking water is supplied, chill some bottled water, or barely freeze a few bottles, to help the cooler ice last longer and give you cool water as needed. Go easy on the soda pop (diuretic) and the fruit juice (insect attractant); if you use fruit juice, pack the concentrate and a container for the diluted juice.
		<p>
			I have done day-trips with nothing but cheese, buns, pepperoni and pickles; for a full day or more, add some real food, either hot or cold, and some nibbles such as nuts and fruit. Couscous salads are now readily available in delis, as well as other interesting foods. Do remember that chicken must be either hot or cold, and must spend very little time in between.
		<p>
			Use alcohol wipes in the travel packs. Take Vitamin B1 to help drive away insects, and use DEET.
