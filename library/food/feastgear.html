        <h3>First Time Tableware</h3>
		<p>
			Yes, medievally, cutlery and tableware was used; fingers may have come into play, but the manuals of the time are quite specific about which fingers were used for what purposes (and I will not attempt to summarize such compexities). And since we neither waste food, nor wish to sully beautiful garments that we (and perhaps you) have spent hours creating, we like our "feastgear".
		<p>
			We encourage the medieval look, but that can come later...

		<ul>
			<li>beverage container (heavy glass goblet will hold hot or cold liquids, as will pottery; metal does not work well with hot; wood may warp with heat)</li>
			<li>bowl (relatively open; most servings will be small and quickly consumed; a salad bowl generally works; a peasant, one-dish meal might require a soup-bowl, but seconds [and thirds] are generally allowed)</li>
			<li>spoon (round or teardrop shape looks right, but whatever works)</li>
			<li>knife (steak knife works, especially as it can stab food that needs it... instead of a fork)</li>
			<li>napkin</li>
			<li>something to carry it all</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Optional Tableware</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>plate (a bowl will handle everything, but sometimes a plate is nicer)</li>
			<li>fork (if you must, or your persona would use one)</li>
			<li>tablecloth, extra napkins</li>
			<li>candle in enclosed glass container</li>
			<li>salt or other seasoning in small bowl/box</li>
			<li>additional bowls and cutlery may be useful (bowls will hold any kind of food, and also beverages, and ort)</li>
		</ul>
