			Competitions come in a wide variety of formats. They range all the way from fun and silly to serious, from most popular to most historically accurate, and from complete novice to very experienced. While there is not necessarily something for everyone in each competition, there is always another competition coming along that will meet your needs and tickle your fancy.

		<p>
			To best match up your expectation with the competition, do two things: a) read the competition copy carefully and, b) speak with the organiser. Find out if you need documentation: spoken (oral), written, how many copies? What time do you need to be ready and how long does the competition last? If your entry needs support stuff (table, electrical outlet, etc.) make arrangements for that now.

		<p>
			What is documentation? It's answering the 5 Ws: Who, What, When, Where, Why + How. Apply these questions to your project, the people who would have made or used it, and also to yourself. How did your creat this and why did you make the choices you did? How is what you did similar or different to the item and what people did 'back then'? Add a museum photo or copy of a painting showing the item and that's it, you're done!

		<p>
			Getting all of this on 1 page, 2 pages if you're going for a Championship, or extra enthusiastic, would be excellent documentation for a Shire-level branch like Hartwood. Remember, not all competitions will require this amount, so check with your competition organiser!

		<p>
			So why participate in competitions? You meet some really cool people. You have a good time challenging yourself with the interesting ways that the fighters, archers, and rapier folks have put their field or shoots together. You can see, hear, and even participate in some amazing crafts, cooking, and bardic from our artisans. Plus, it's fun. You could compete for bragging rights, for a prize, to demonstrate a new skill you've learned, as part of a Principality or Kingdom or even SCA-wide Guild challenge.

		<p>
			Or you could compete for the honour of being one of Hartwood's (#) Champions and represent the branch for a year. (Add rights and responsibilities).

		<p>
			In the end, there's a competition for everyone. From the person in their first month in the SCA to our Peers. From someone who wants something silly to do for their Saturday evening to someone who wants to work hard for months to achieve a long-held dream. From the folks who think documentation is scary and only want to talk about their projects to those who have no problems whipping out an essay. Hartwood has people who can answer questions and mentor you if you need it, or leave you be and watch you bloom. Come, compete!
