			Many people get into the SCA and make a persona based on certain period of time or a certain style of clothing and then decide they want to get into the combat arts. Suddenly they realize their persona wouldn’t fight in that style. What do I do now? Don’t worry about it if this happens. One is not necessarily linked to the other.
	
		<p>
			However, if you decide you want to make a persona based on a fighting style and period of history, great. Do some research for what was going on in your time period. Talk to fighters who fight your style, eg if you want to do a late 1500s rapier fighter, talk to the rapier fighters in the shire. They will be able to tell you a little about what masters were teaching during that time and what styles were popular (both fighting styles and clothing/armour).

			Do I have to go out and spend a thousand dollars to get all the armour and weapons I need to fight? Most of the time the shires have what is called iron key, which is loaner gear. This is a great way to start out fighting and finding out what style you want to do without shelling out a bunch of money right up front.
	
		<p>
			So I have decided I want to fight. Now do I have to spend a small fortune to have my own gear? You can but it is not necessary. Most of the experienced fighters can help you put together functional armour for a lower cost. For example, the heavy armour does not need to be made out of the shiny stainless steel. Many people fight in armour made out of plastic pickle barrel and cover it up with a nice tunic. Used gear can be bought at a reduced cost to get you started and unless it is coloured up with specific heraldry, no one will know but you.
