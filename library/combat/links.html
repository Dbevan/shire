        <p>
			Below are some helpful links for those interested in combat. The forms can all be found on the <a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/#marshal target=_blank>Kingdom Website</a>. The most commonly used forms for all disciplines are:
			
        <ul>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/15_4_YearAuthorization.pdf target=_blank>4 Year Authorization</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/16_Marshal_Promotion.pdf target=_blank>Martial Promotion</a></li>
        </ul>
		
        <p>
			Martials are our safety officers, and are required to have any marshal activities in the branch. If you wish to help our sports grow, then you will require both a 4-Year Authorization and a marshal promotion form to be filled out by a Senior Martial, regardless of discipline. You can check your combat authorizations and marshal status on the <a href=http://antirlists.org/ target=_blank>online database</a>.
			
        <h3>Archery, Thrown Weapons, and Siege</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/15_4_YearAuthorization.pdf target=_blank>An Tir Book of Target</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/Abc/ABC_11thEdition2015.pdf target=_blank>An Tir Book of Combat, 11th Edition</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://scores-sca.org/home/index.php?R=23" target=_blank>Scores Site: Thrown Weapons</a></li>
        </ul>
		
        <p>
			All Target Archers and Throwers should have a copy of, and review, the Book of Target. This is our rules and guidelines. Likewise, all Combat Archers, Throwers, and Siege Crew should have a copy of, and review, the An Tir Book of Combat.

        <p>
			We participate in an internationtional competition called 'Royal Rounds', in which all participants engage in a defined challenge and record our scores. The Scores Site can help you track your progress.
        
		<p>
			Target Archers and Throwers do not require 4-Year Authorizations to participate. Combat Archers, Combat Throwers, and Siege Crew do require a 4-Year Authorization.

        <h3>Heavy Armoured, Rapier, and Cut &amp; Thrust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/Abc/ABC_11thEdition2015.pdf target=_blank>An Tir Book of Combat, 11th Edition</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/AnTirArmyHandbookJan2010.pdf target=_blank>An Tir Army Handbook</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/Rapier/ABCs%20Rapier%20(Dec%202016).pdf target=_blank>An Tir Book of Rapier Combat</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/Rapier/ApprovedBladeListSept2014.pdf target=_blank>Book of Approved Blades</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/Rapier/C&amp;T%20manual%20201.pdf target=_blank>An Tir Book of Cut &amp; Thrust Combat</a></li>
        </ul>
		
        <p>
			All Heavily Armoured combatants should have a copy of, and review, the An Tir Book of Combat (ABC's), all Rapier combatants the An Tir Book of Rapier Combat, and all Cut and Thrust combatants the An Tir Book of Cut and Thrust Combat. These are our rules and guidelines. Those who intent to participate in inter-Kingdom war scenarios should review the An Tir Army Handbook as well.
			
        <p>
			Rapier and Cut and Thrust use metal swords; to ensure the safety of all participants, An Tir has a list of approved manufacturers that can be found in the Book of Approved Blades.
			
        <p>
			All combatants will have to be authorized by a marshal before being permitted to compete in tourney or participate in war at an event. This is to ensure you understand the rules and are properly able to gauge blows. For this, you require a 4-year Authorization.

        <h3>Youth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/YouthCombat2008.pdf target=_blank>An Tir Book of Youth Armoured Combat</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/52_2YearYouth.pdf target=_blank>2-Year Authorization for Youth Armoured Combat</a></li>
            <li><a href=http://antir.sca.org/Pubs/forms/53_MinorWaiverCombat.pdf target=_blank>Youth Combat Waiver</a></li>
            <li class=notice>The Book of Youth Rapier has been approved and is awaiting signatures. As soon as it is released, the Webteam will update this list.</li>
        </ul>
		
        <p>
			While our Target sports seamlessly integrate youth participation above a minimum age, contact sports require more consideration. An Tir supports youth Armoured Combat, and soon youth Rapier. To participate, both parent and child should read and understand the relevant books of Youth Combat, and fill out a waiver.
			
        <p>
			Like adult combat, all youth combatants will have to be authorized by a marshal before being permitted to compete at an event. This is to ensure you understand the rules and are properly able to gauge blows. For this, you require a 2-year Authorization.
			
        <p>
			A gentle reminder, all youth participants must be accompanied by a responsible adult during marshal activities.
