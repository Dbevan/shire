			The Shire of Hartwood likes to show it's gratitude towards members who are especially skilled or generous with their time and efforts. While we may not provide awards (as a Barony can), we may offer small tokens of appreciation. Here is a description of what some members have recieved:
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Exemplar</dt>
			<dd>Embodying the spirit and virtues our Society holds dear; courtesy, honour, kindness and generosity. An Honour held for one year only, it is then passed from the existing Exemplar onto the next.</dd>
			
			<dt>Stag Tag</dt>
			<dt>Combat Arts: Armoured, Rapier, Cut &amp; Thrust, Combat Archery, Combat Thrown Weapons, Jousting</dt>
			<dd>Recognition of an individual who, while residing in Hartwood, has fought in the Combat Arts with their own kit under Hartwood’s banner. This specifically means one who has particpated in a group war event, or fought as Champion of Hartwood. This token is not one that requires recommendation, but rather it is earned. The most common event it's earned at is Sealion War.</dd>
			
			<dt>Raven Tag</dt>
			<dt>Target/Equestrian Arts: Target Archery, Thrown Weapons, Equestrian</dt>
